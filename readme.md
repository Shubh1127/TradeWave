#TradeWave<br>
TradeWave is a modern trading platform inspired by Zerodha, designed to provide users with seamless trading and investment tools. This project is divided<br> into three core parts:<br>
<br>
Frontend: Handles the user-facing part of the platform.<br>
Dashboard: Displays a comprehensive interface for users to monitor their investments and perform trades.<br>
Backend: Manages the server-side logic, APIs, and database connections.<br>
<br>
The frontend folder contains all the code for the user interface, built with modern JavaScript frameworks (e.g., React). This section includes the signup/<br>login, trading, and market data features.<br>
<br>
Dashboard<br>
The dashboard folder contains the admin/user dashboard where users can view their investment portfolios, transaction history, and real-time market stats.<br>
<br>
Backend<br>
The backend folder contains the Express server, API routes, and the logic for handling user authentication, data fetching from market APIs, and database <br>interactions.<br>
